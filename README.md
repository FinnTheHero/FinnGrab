# FinnGrab - System Information Display Tool

FinnGrab is a personal project aimed at creating a system information display tool using C++. Similar to its predecessor, "FinnGet," which was implemented as a PowerShell module, FinnGrab is designed to provide essential system information in a more performance-oriented language.

## Project Overview

FinnGrab utilizes C++ to gather and display fundamental system information, including the "FinnGrab" version, screen resolution, uptime, and RAM details. The tool is executed by running the `finngrabrunner.ps1` PowerShell script, which automates the process of compiling, running, displaying the information, and cleaning up the executable file afterward.

Please note that the project is a work in progress and is currently focused on printing the specified system information. Future updates may include additional features and improvements.

## Getting Started

To use FinnGrab and display system information on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have PowerShell installed on your system.

2. Clone the FinnGrab repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finngrab.git

   ```

4. Run the `finngrabrunner.ps1` script:

   ```

5. The script will compile and execute the C++ program, displaying the following system information:
   - "FinnGrab" version
   - Screen resolution
